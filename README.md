# Telegram-Automation
### Automating conversations on Telegram. 
Using the Telegram API, this program connects with your telegram account. Following the connection it will automatically reply to generic messages in use on your Telegram.  
Conversations vary with the people you interact with and this program can be customised accordingly. You can edit the messages you send, set the messages which trigger a response and much more. You can even incorporate other APIs and services with Telegram and enjoy them on a single platform itself.  
Become a Pro Telegram User with this program :)
